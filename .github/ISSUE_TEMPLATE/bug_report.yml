              # Thank you for opening an issue.

              Please ensure that your request is distinct from other issues. If you have any further questions on the contributing process, please read the CONTRIBUTING.md at https://github.com/jchen42703/create-fullstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

              ## Filing a bug report

              To fix problems, we need clear reproduction cases - we need to be able to see it happen locally. A reproduction case is ideally something a Terraform Core engineer can git-clone or copy-paste and run immediately, without inventing any details or context.

              * A short example can be directly copy-pasteable; longer examples should be in separate git repositories, especially if multiple files are needed
              * Please include all needed context. For example, if you figured out that an expression can cause a crash, put the expression in a variable definition or a resource
              * Set defaults on (or omit) any variables. The person reproducing it should not need to invent variable settings
              * If multiple steps are required, such as running terraform twice, consider scripting it in a simple shell script. Providing a script can be easier than explaining what changes to make to the config between runs.
              * Omit any unneeded complexity: remove variables, conditional statements, functions, modules, providers, and resources that are not needed to trigger the bug
              * When possible, use the [null resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/resource.html) provider rather than a real provider in order to minimize external dependencies. We know this isn't always feasible. The Terraform Core team doesn't have deep domain knowledge in every provider, or access to every cloud platform for reproduction cases.

              For example: is Terraform running in a wrapper script or in a CI system? Are you passing any unusual command line options or environment variables to opt-in to non-default behavior?"
